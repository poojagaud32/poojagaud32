Data Types:

What are primitive data types in programming?

Primitive data types are basic data types provided by a programming language to represent simple values like integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.
Explain the difference between int and float data types.

Int (integer) represents whole numbers, while float represents numbers with decimal points.
What is the purpose of a string data type?

The string data type is used to store sequences of characters, such as words or sentences.
What is typecasting, and why is it important with data types?

Typecasting is the process of converting one data type to another. It's important to ensure compatibility and avoid data loss.
What is the difference between dynamic and static typing?

Dynamic typing allows variables to change data types during runtime, whereas static typing enforces type checking at compile-time.
Operators:

Explain the difference between unary, binary, and ternary operators.

Unary operators work on a single operand, binary operators work on two operands, and ternary operators work on three operands.
What is operator precedence, and why is it important?

Operator precedence defines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. It's important to avoid ambiguity and ensure correct computation.
What is the difference between the '==' operator and the '===' operator in JavaScript?

'==' checks for equality in value, while '===' checks for equality in value and data type.
What is the purpose of the modulus (%) operator?

The modulus operator returns the remainder when one number is divided by another. It's often used in operations involving multiples or divisibility.
Conditional Statements:

What are conditional statements, and why are they used in programming?

Conditional statements allow you to execute different code blocks based on certain conditions, enhancing the control flow of a program.
Explain the difference between 'if', 'else if', and 'else' statements.

'if' is used to test a condition, 'else if' is used to test additional conditions, and 'else' is a fallback for when no conditions are met.
What is a switch statement, and when is it preferable over multiple 'if' statements?

A switch statement is used to select one of many code blocks to be executed. It's preferable over 'if' statements when you have multiple conditions to check against a single value.
Looping Statements:

What is a for loop, and how does it work?

A for loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code for a specified number of times, controlled by an iterator.
Explain the difference between 'while' and 'do-while' loops.

'while' loops check the condition before execution, while 'do-while' loops execute the code at least once and then check the condition.
What is an infinite loop, and how can you prevent it?

An infinite loop is a loop that never terminates. To prevent it, ensure that there's a way for the loop condition to become false.
Functions:

What is a function in programming, and why is it used?

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It's used to modularize code and improve code organization.
What is a parameter in a function, and why are they important?

Parameters are variables that are used to pass values into a function. They allow you to customize the behavior of a function.
What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?

A function declaration is hoisted and can be called before its declaration, while a function expression is not hoisted and must be defined before use.
What is the return statement in a function, and why is it used?

The return statement is used to specify the value that a function should output. It allows functions to produce results.
What is a recursive function, and when is it useful?

A recursive function is a function that calls itself. It's useful for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.
